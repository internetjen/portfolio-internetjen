                    From an early age, I was captivated by the power of
                    technology and its ability to shape the world. Technology
                    helped me to stay in touch with my family back in Ecuador, it
                    helped me make LGBTQ+ connections during a very isolating
                    time, and it helped me find my voice as an individual.
                  </p>

                  <p className="mt-6 text-lg leading-8">
                    This fascination led me to pursue a career in development,
                    where I constantly strive to push boundaries and stay at the
                    forefront of emerging technologies.
